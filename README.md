# C Programming - Formative Project 1

This project contains four programming problems implemented in C and C++ (for Arduino), which demonstrates core concepts of programming, hardware interaction, and algorithm design.

## Repository Structure

The project is divided into four main sections (Questions 1-4). Each directory contains the source code and documentation detailing the proof of concept (PoC), requirements, and analysis.

- **`Q1-WaterQuality/`**: A C program modeling the processing step of a water quality device monitor. It takes temperature and turbidity readings, calculates a water quality index, and classifies the water status. Includes an explanation of the C compilation lifecycle and error analysis.
- **`Q2-TransactionProcess/`**: A C program simulating a mobile money transaction system terminal. It handles deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks while demonstrating the usage of loops, conditionals, `break`, and `continue` statements.
- **`Q3-DeliveryAnalysis/`**: A C program for a logistics company to analyze delivery routes. It calculates total distance, average distance, longest route, and counts routes above a limit. This section specifically emphasizes array manipulation and recursive problem-solving.
- **`Q4-SmartParking/`**: An Arduino (.ino) smart parking system project using an ultrasonic sensor to detect vehicle occupancy and control indicators (LEDs and a buzzer).

## Directions & Instructions

### Exploring the Documentation
Each sub-folder contains a `docs/` directory. For a comprehensive explanation of how each program works, its design decisions, and its real-world applications, please refer to the `PoC-*.md` documents located inside the `docs/` folder of the respective question.

### Running the C Programs (Q1, Q2, Q3)
To compile and run the standard C programs (`Q1-WaterQuality`, `Q2-TransactionProcess`, `Q3-DeliveryAnalysis`), you will need a C compiler such as `gcc`. 

Navigate to the directory of the program you wish to run and use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Example for Q1-WaterQuality
cd Q1-WaterQuality

# Compile the code
gcc waterquality.c -o waterquality

# Run the executable
./waterquality
```
*(Repeat the same pattern for `Q2-TransactionProcess/transactionprocessing.c` and `Q3-DeliveryAnalysis/deliveryanalysis.c`)*
